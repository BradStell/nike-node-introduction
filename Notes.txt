1. Explain Node and how it executes JS outside of browser
  - index.html vs .js file
    - open index.html file in browser and log hello world
    - run hello world in node.js
  - browser console vs node REPL demonstration

2. declaring variables
  - use let and demonstrate logging different types
    - let x = 3           // number
    - let x = 3.14        // number (floating point)
    - let x = 'three'     // string
    - let x = true        // boolean
  - show how in javascript you can reasign a different "type" value to any variable
    - let x = 3
      x = 'three'
      x = true
  - show use of const
    - let x = 3
      x = 'three' // error
  - talk about how we use linters and typescript to avoid these problems

3. declaring functions
  - function that adds two numbers
  - function that prints hello in different language based on if statement
  - show how leaving off parameters results in undefined but still valid executable code

4. objects
  - show how to create an object
  - show how you can add new keys to objects at runtime
  - show how a function can modify object from calling code

5. arrays
  - demonstrate creating array with items in it
  - demonstrate some array methods
    push, pop, shift
  - demonstrate mixing types

5.a fancy stuff
  - function expressions
  - object keys same as value

6. immutability and copying data

7. module system
  - commonjs (node)

8. promises async/await

9. destructuring objects and arrays

10. Nodejs api
  - read/write file
  - url parsing
  - streams
  - crypto

11. 3rd party packages

12. eslint

13. typescript

14. Web server
  - node.js
  - express
  - show others (fastify)
